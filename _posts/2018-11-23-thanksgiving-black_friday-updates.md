I missed 5 months of posting, because of how responsible an individual I am. Sorry about that.

Firstly, happy Turkey Day and Day of Materialism to the Americans here.

Secondly, I will be trying to post more consistenly as I have said repeatedly over the course of making this comic and blog. That will hopefully start tomorrow.

Thanks for being patient.
