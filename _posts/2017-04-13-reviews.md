I will start this off by saying that I apologize for not posting new comics. I have them made (you can check on the github page), I just forgot to post them because I am extremely responsible.

Anyways, the topic of this post is on reviews. If you didn't notice from my last blog post, I hate the current use of review scores. This is due to the fact that everyone has a different way of assigning the score. Take for example IGN's scores, which used to be very inflated (usually near 10), whereas PCGamer never gives out 10s. I assign review scores on a scale almost completely different from everyone else, in which I am not afraid to give a game a sub-7 score if it deserves it. Also, my scoring system uses the idea that the middle of the set of numbers being used (5 in my case) should be the score for games that are average. Due to this difference, people should stop caring about the score and instead focus on the words contained within the review, the positives and negatives of the game. However, that is unlikely to happen due to the fact that people are lazy, which is completely natural.

I will likely expand my reviews to add more games and start reviewing music (most likely punk rock, pop punk, and 00's pop because that is the music that I listen to regularly). I also will (hopefully) have a reviews section on my website, as well as tags for organizing this mess of a blog.
