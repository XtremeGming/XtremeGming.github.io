So, now that 2017 is over, I thought it would be time to look back on the year in gaming and see if I wanted to award games something. So here are my awards for games released in 2017.
So, I bought very few new games in 2017, simply because nothing excited me particularly. There were only two games I bought in 2017 when they were new: PUBG and Life is Strange: Before the Storm. PUBG is still a mess, especially the volume, so that earns nothing, but I am very tempted to give it the Largest Letdown Award. Life is Strange: Before the Storm is a decent game. But, going into it from the amazing Life is Strange. I just haven't enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed Life is Strange the original.
Factorio has been the game I have been playing most this year, along with RimWorld. I am going to give RimWorld the most improved Early Access game, especially as it has now gone to beta. Factorio will get the Addiction Award, because it is addicting as hell. Just browse the Factorio subreddit and you will see what I mean.
I will award Star Wars Battlefront II (the new one) the Worst Name Award, for obvious reasons, as well as the Kick in the Teeth Award, due to those "micro"transactions and the horrible release state of it. There is no excuse for their greed and the release state of the game.
Anyway, in summary, 2017 wasn't a great year of games, but some Early Access games are doing well.
