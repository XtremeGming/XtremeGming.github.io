So, I haven't watched much on TV, but I have recently started watching The Joy of Painting (aka Bob Ross's show) and OH MY GOD. It is amazing. His voice is so calming, it is basically ASMR that doesn't freak me out. It also is providing material for me to listen to while developing games. Seriously, go find the YouTube channel that seems to have every Joy of Painting episode uploaded on it and organized into playlists by season. Also, the Twitch channel is great for having a curated playlist while working on stuff during the weekend. Anyways, I wholeheartedly recommend watching The Joy of Painting through one of the sources available online!
