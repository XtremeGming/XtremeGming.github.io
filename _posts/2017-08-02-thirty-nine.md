Here is the 39th comic! Just a quick note: the TARDIS in this was built by Nerdcubed on YouTube (Playlist for entire series: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4Sz7_l-PtwAeZxPVktRrMwu4JLZW7aXF">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4Sz7_l-PtwAeZxPVktRrMwu4JLZW7aXF</a>; Start at video 17 for the TARDIS build). Also, the comments will be hosted on my subreddit (linked below). Anyways, enjoy!
