Happy belated Festivus to all! Also, happy nearly-New Year! So, after another little break, I am back! I have thought over it, and decided that I should post here more often, and thus have come up with a little schedule:
<!--excerpt cutoff-->
<ul>
<li>Sunday: Post a news roundup</li>
<li>Monday: Post a comic at 0:01 UTC</li>
<li>Tuesday: Post about anything</li>
<li>Wednesday: Post a comic at 0:01 UTC or post a review of what I've been watching on TV/a recent episode</li>
<li>Thursday: Post a game review or first impression post</li>
<li>Friday: Post something in the style of PCGamer's "What are you playing this weekend"</li>
<li>Saturday: Post a review of the recent Doctor Who episode and possibly a new Plays or other video on YouTube</li>
</ul>
There is the new (and possibly to be used) schedule. I will try to stick to it, but no promises. Anyway, thanks for reading and feel free to comment over on the subreddit!
