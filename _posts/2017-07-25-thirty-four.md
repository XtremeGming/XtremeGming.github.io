Here is the 34th comic! I am not entirely sure on how I handled the division of dialogue between the two characters in this comic.

In my personal video gaming life, I have redownloaded Left 4 Dead 2 and have been playing it a fair bit over the last few days, as well as going back to GTAV for making stuff and just messing around. A machinima should be released on my channel soon.

Anyhow, enjoy!
