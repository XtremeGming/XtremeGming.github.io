Here is the 53rd issue! I have been playing an unhealthy amount of FIFA 17 lately, on the manager career mode. There will be a post on it, but, spoiler alert, I have managed to bring Shrewsbury from third flight to the Premier League. Also, I am about halfway through editing a Ways to Die video for Sniper Elite 4. That should be out by next week if I can be bothered to edit.
Enjoy!
