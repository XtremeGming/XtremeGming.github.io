Here is the 38th comic! Sorry about this being about 2 hours late, I was downloading and playing games from Origin Access (mainly Titanfall and BF4) and lost track of time. Also, maintaining that streak of posts into August failed, but I will try to get one comic up every day from here onwards. Also, I am trying to figure out how to do a comments section and a donation button (because I need the money for this to keep reasonably going). Anyways, enjoy!
