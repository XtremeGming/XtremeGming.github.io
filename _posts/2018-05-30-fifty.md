Here is the 50th issue! Woo! Party! In about 1 and 3 quarters years, I have posted about 50 comics, or about 29 per year. Not awful, but not where I'd like to be. So, I am committing to posting one comic a day from now until the beginning of September. This will go better than the last time I said that.
Enjoy the comic!
