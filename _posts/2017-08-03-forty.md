Here is the 40th comic! Just a quick note: the TARDIS in this was built by Nerdcubed on YouTube (Playlist for entire series: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4Sz7_l-PtwAeZxPVktRrMwu4JLZW7aXF">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4Sz7_l-PtwAeZxPVktRrMwu4JLZW7aXF</a>; Start at video 17 for the TARDIS build). I have been getting quite the amount of fun out of Origin Access, mostly due to Mini Metro and BF4 Premium. Anyways, enjoy!
