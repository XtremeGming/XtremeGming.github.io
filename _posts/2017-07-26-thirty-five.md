Here is the 35th comic! I proved to myself that I could actually make a comic in under an hour, meaning that almost everyday I should be able to make a comic, so expect more comics coming up. Also, this is the 5th comic in 5 days, meaning that I'm on a streak! Hopefully I can keep this going through August or at least into August. Anyways, enjoy!
