Well, the new schedule is going well, as no new episode of Dr. Who aired and I missed the Christmas Special, but will hopefully be finding a way to watch it, so a review of it should be out soon.
As I don't have a video ready for today, I will give a slight hint at what the new video is, which will come out on January 6th, which is next Saturday. It is a GTA V machinima that was inspired by an old piece of NerdÂ³ machinima, which he has previously stated is his favorite machinima that he has done. It will be released at 4PM Eastern or 9PM UTC. Thanks for reading, and happy very-nearly-New Year.
