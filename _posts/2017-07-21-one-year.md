On July 12th 2016, I started this site in order to host my webcomic. Now, a little over a year later, the website has changed some, but has stayed roughly the same. In that time, the comic has released 30 issues, meaning I missed 22 issues (whoops). In the next year, my goal for the comic is to actually get out the comic on time, plus another day during the week. For the site, I hope to add a comments section and add the ability for donations for if you wish to support me. Anyways, happy one year birthday (?) to the site!
