Here is the 36th comic! Today, I got around to playing Shadow Warrior, and it is amazing. The combat feels great, with the very high pace, especially in melee. I don't care for the story, but that is fine, as the gameplay doesn't really rely on it. Also, comments should be on here soon through Disqus. Hopefully this will go well.
Anyways, enjoy!
